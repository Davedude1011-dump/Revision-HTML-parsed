            <div class="header">Higher-Grade Electricity: In-Depth Exploration of Key Concepts</div>

            <div class="header">1. Current (I)</div>
            <div class="text">Electric current (I) is the flow of electric charge. It is measured in amperes (A) and represents the rate of flow of charge through a conductor. In a circuit, current flows from areas of high potential (voltage) to areas of low potential, following Ohm's Law (I = V/R).</div>

            <div class="header">2. Voltage (V)</div>
            <div class="text">Voltage (V) is the electric potential difference between two points in a circuit. It is measured in volts (V). Voltage drives the flow of current, and a higher voltage leads to a greater potential for current flow. Ohm's Law relates voltage, current, and resistance (V = IR).</div>

            <div class="header">3. Resistance (R)</div>
            <div class="text">Resistance (R) is the hindrance to the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms (Ω). Materials with high resistance impede current flow, while conductors with low resistance allow easy flow. Ohm's Law helps quantify the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance (R = V/I).</div>

            <div class="header">4. Ohm's Law</div>
            <div class="text">Ohm's Law, formulated by Georg Simon Ohm, states that the current passing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points, given a constant temperature. The law is expressed as I = V/R, where I is current, V is voltage, R is resistance, and is measured in ohms (Ω).</div>

            <div class="header">5. Coulomb (C)</div>
            <div class="text">The coulomb (C) is the unit of electric charge. One coulomb is equivalent to the charge transported by a current of one ampere in one second. It is a fundamental quantity in understanding the flow of charge in electrical circuits and is related to current and time (Q = It).</div>

            <div class="header">6. Electric Field</div>
            <div class="text">The electric field is a region around charged particles where a force is exerted on other charged particles. It is a vector field with both magnitude and direction. The strength of the electric field is proportional to the force it exerts on charges within the field.</div>

            <div class="header">7. Capacitance (C)</div>
            <div class="text">Capacitance is the ability of a system to store electric charge. It is measured in farads (F). A capacitor, a common electrical component, consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulator. The capacitance of a capacitor depends on the surface area of the plates and the distance between them.</div>

            <div class="header">8. Electrical Power (P)</div>
            <div class="text">Electrical power (P) is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted. It is measured in watts (W). The relationship between power, voltage, and current is given by P = VI, where P is power, V is voltage, I is current, and is measured in watts (W).</div>

            <div class="header">9. Ohmic and Non-Ohmic Conductors</div>
            <div class="text">Ohmic conductors follow Ohm's Law linearly, maintaining a constant resistance regardless of voltage. Non-ohmic conductors, like diodes or semiconductors, exhibit varying resistance with changing voltage, deviating from Ohm's Law.</div>

            <div class="header">10. Superconductivity</div>
            <div class="text">Superconductivity is a phenomenon where certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance at extremely low temperatures. Superconductors have practical applications in technologies like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines and maglev trains.</div>

            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">Understanding these key concepts in higher-grade electricity, including current, voltage, resistance, Ohm's Law, coulombs, electric fields, capacitance, electrical power, and special cases like superconductivity, provides a solid foundation for analyzing and working with advanced electrical systems. Ohm's Law, expressed as I = V/R, with resistance measured in ohms (Ω), is a fundamental tool in electrical analysis.</div>
