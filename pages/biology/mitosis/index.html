            <div class="header">Overview</div>
            <div class="text">Mitosis is a fundamental process in cell biology that allows a single eukaryotic cell to divide its nucleus into two identical nuclei. It plays a crucial role in growth, tissue repair, and maintaining the body's genetic stability. In this explanation, we'll focus specifically on the process of mitosis and the steps involved in splitting the cell's nuclei while leaving out the details of cytokinesis, which deals with the division of the entire cell. For information on cytokinesis click <a href="../cytokinesis/index.html" class="link">here</a>. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of mitosis:</div>
            
            <div class="header">1. Interphase:</div>
            <div class="text">Before mitosis begins, the cell goes through an initial stage called interphase. During interphase, the cell carries out its normal functions and prepares for division. This includes replicating its DNA so that each daughter cell will have a complete set of genetic information.</div>
            
            <div class="header">2. Prophase:</div>
            <div class="text">This marks the start of mitosis. In prophase, the chromatin (a complex of DNA and proteins) condenses into visible chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids, held together by a structure called the centromere. The nuclear envelope also begins to break down during this phase.</div>
            
            <div class="header">3. Metaphase:</div>
            <div class="text">During metaphase, the chromosomes align at the cell's equatorial plane, known as the metaphase plate. This alignment ensures that when the cell divides, each daughter cell will receive an equal number of chromosomes.</div>
            
            <div class="header">4. Anaphase:</div>
            <div class="text">In anaphase, the sister chromatids are separated. The centromere splits, and motor proteins pull the chromatids towards opposite poles of the cell. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes.</div>
            
            <div class="header">5. Telophase:</div>
            <div class="text">Telophase marks the near-end of mitosis. During this phase, the separated chromatids, now called individual chromosomes, gather at opposite ends of the cell. The nuclear envelope begins to reform around each set of chromosomes, creating two distinct nuclei.</div>

            <div class="header">6. Cytokinesis:</div>
            <div class="text">After Mitosis, the cell undergoes Cytokinesis to finish the division. Click <a href="../cytokinesis/index.html" class="link">here</a>, to learn more about Cytokinesis.</div>

            <div class="header">Summery</div>
            <div class="text">In summary, Mitosis is the process by which a single cell splits its nucleus into two identical nuclei. It ensures that each daughter nucleus receives an identical set of chromosomes with the same genetic information as the parent nucleus. This process is crucial for growth, tissue repair, and maintaining the genetic stability of an organism. Cytokinesis, which follows mitosis, is responsible for dividing the rest of the cell to create two separate daughter cells.</div>
