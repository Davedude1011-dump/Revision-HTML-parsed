            <div class="header">Cytokinesis:</div>
            <div class="text">As we discussed earlier, cytokinesis is the final step in cell division, following mitosis, you can read more about mitosis <a href="../mitosis/index.html" class="link">here</a>. It is the process by which the cytoplasm of the cell is divided into two separate daughter cells, each with its own nucleus and set of organelles. Here's a breakdown of cytokinesis:</div>
            
            <div class="header">1. Telophase Continuation:</div>
            <div class="text"> Cytokinesis typically begins during late telophase, which is the final stage of mitosis. During telophase, you already have two separate sets of chromosomes in distinct nuclei at opposite ends of the cell.</div>
            
            <div class="header">2. Cleavage Furrow (Animal Cells):</div>
            <div class="text">In animal cells, the process of cytokinesis involves the formation of a structure called the cleavage furrow. This is like a contractile ring made of actin filaments that encircles the center of the cell, right where the metaphase plate used to be.</div>
            
            <div class="header">3. Cell Membrane Pinching:</div>
            <div class="text">The cleavage furrow gradually tightens like a drawstring, pinching the cell membrane inwards. This inward pinching continues until the membrane eventually fuses, splitting the cell into two daughter cells. Each daughter cell now has its own nucleus and organelles.</div>

            <div class="header">4. Cell Plate Formation (Plant Cells):</div>
            <div class="text">In plant cells, the process of cytokinesis is a bit different due to the presence of a rigid cell wall. Instead of a cleavage furrow, plant cells form a structure known as the cell plate. During late telophase, vesicles containing cell wall materials accumulate at the center of the cell.</div>
            
            <div class="header">5. Cell Wall Synthesis:</div>
            <div class="text">These vesicles fuse together, forming the cell plate. Enzymes and other materials are added to the cell plate, causing it to grow and eventually fuse with the existing cell membrane. This creates a new cell wall between the two daughter cells.</div>

            <div class="header">6. Completion of Cytokinesis:</div>
            <div class="text">Once the cell membrane is fully pinched in (in animal cells) or the cell plate has developed into a new cell wall (in plant cells), cytokinesis is complete. You now have two separate daughter cells, each genetically identical to the original parent cell.</div>

            <br><br>
            <div class="text">Cytokinesis is essential because it ensures that the genetic material previously separated during mitosis is now housed in two separate, functional cells. This division is crucial for the growth, development, and repair of multicellular organisms.</div>
