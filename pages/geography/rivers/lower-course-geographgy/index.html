            <div class="header">The Lower Course of a River: Features and Processes</div>

            <div class="text">The lower course of a river is the final segment where the river meets the sea or another body of water. This stretch is characterized by distinct features and processes shaped by the river's journey from its source. Let's explore the key aspects of the lower course geography of a river.</div>
            
            <div class="header">1. River Mouth and Estuary Formation</div>
            <div class="text">- **River Mouth:** The lower course begins with the river mouth, where the river discharges its water into the sea or a larger body of water. This often marks the end of the river's erosional activities.</div>
            <div class="text">- **Estuary:** In many cases, the river mouth forms an estuary, a partially enclosed coastal body of water where freshwater from the river mixes with saltwater from the sea. Estuaries are dynamic ecosystems supporting diverse flora and fauna.</div>
            
            <div class="header">2. Depositional Features</div>
            <div class="text">- **Delta Formation:** Deltas are landforms created by the deposition of sediment carried by the river. This sediment accumulates and forms a triangular or fan-shaped area at the river's mouth. Deltas are often characterized by distributaries, smaller channels that branch out from the main river.</div>
            <div class="text">- **Levees:** Along the lower course, natural levees may form parallel to the riverbanks due to the deposition of coarser sediments during floods. These elevated ridges help contain the river within its channel.</div>
            
            <div class="header">3. River Velocity and Discharge</div>
            <div class="text">- **Reduced Velocity:** As the river widens in the lower course, its velocity decreases. The reduced velocity leads to the deposition of sediment, contributing to the formation of depositional features like deltas and levees.</div>
            <div class="text">- **Increased Discharge:** The river's discharge, or the volume of water passing through a cross-section of the river, tends to increase in the lower course due to the accumulation of tributaries along its journey.</div>
            
            <div class="header">4. Human Interaction and Land Use</div>
            <div class="text">- **Urbanization:** Cities and urban areas are often established along the lower course of rivers due to the availability of flat and fertile land. However, this proximity to water poses challenges related to flooding and land management.</div>
            <div class="text">- **Agriculture:** The fertile soils of river deltas attract agriculture. However, the alteration of natural river processes and the withdrawal of water for irrigation can impact the ecosystem and contribute to land subsidence.</div>
            
            <div class="header">5. Flooding and Floodplain Dynamics</div>
            <div class="text">- **Seasonal Flooding:** The lower course may experience seasonal flooding, especially during periods of heavy rainfall. This flooding is influenced by factors such as snowmelt, rainfall, and upstream dam operations.</div>
            <div class="text">- **Floodplain Dynamics:** Floodplains in the lower course play a crucial role in nutrient cycling and supporting diverse ecosystems. However, human activities and modifications can alter these dynamics.</div>
            
            <div class="header">Conclusion</div>
            <div class="text">The lower course of a river showcases the culmination of its journey, characterized by depositional features, interactions with the sea, and human activities. Understanding the dynamics of the lower course is essential for managing land use, preserving ecosystems, and addressing the challenges posed by natural processes and human interventions.</div>
