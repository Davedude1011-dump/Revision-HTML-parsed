            <div class="header">Medicine Through Time: Modern Era</div>

            <div class="text">The modern era of medicine encompasses the 20th century to the present day, marked by unprecedented advancements in medical science, technology, and healthcare delivery. This overview explores key developments that have shaped contemporary medicine.</div>

            <div class="header">Biomedical Advances</div>
            <div class="text">The modern era witnessed groundbreaking biomedical advances, including the discovery of DNA's structure by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. This breakthrough laid the foundation for genetic research, precision medicine, and advancements in understanding hereditary diseases.</div>

            <div class="header">Vaccines and Immunization</div>
            <div class="text">The development and widespread use of vaccines revolutionized public health. Vaccines have played a pivotal role in eradicating or controlling infectious diseases, such as smallpox, polio, and more recently, efforts to combat global health challenges like COVID-19.</div>

            <div class="header">Antibiotics and Antimicrobial Agents</div>
            <div class="text">The discovery of antibiotics, starting with penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928, transformed the treatment of bacterial infections. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, posing new challenges for healthcare.</div>

            <div class="header">Medical Imaging and Technology</div>
            <div class="text">Advancements in medical imaging, from X-rays to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), have revolutionized diagnostics. Modern technology, such as telemedicine and wearable devices, has also expanded access to healthcare services.</div>

            <div class="header">Organ Transplants and Transplantation Ethics</div>
            <div class="text">Organ transplantation became a viable medical treatment in the modern era, offering new hope for patients with failing organs. However, ethical considerations regarding organ donation, allocation, and transplantation practices continue to be subjects of ongoing debate.</div>

            <div class="header">Pharmaceutical Innovations</div>
            <div class="text">The pharmaceutical industry has seen remarkable innovations in drug development, leading to the discovery of medications for various conditions. Biotechnology and personalized medicine are areas of ongoing research and development.</div>

            <div class="header">Global Health Challenges</div>
            <div class="text">The modern era has confronted global health challenges, including pandemics, emerging infectious diseases, and non-communicable diseases. International collaboration and public health initiatives aim to address these complex issues.</div>

            <div class="header">Ethical Considerations and Patient Rights</div>
            <div class="text">Advancements in medicine have prompted discussions on ethical considerations and patient rights. Issues such as informed consent, end-of-life care, and the balance between medical progress and ethical boundaries are central to contemporary healthcare discussions.</div>

            <div class="header">Continual Evolution</div>
            <div class="text">Medicine in the modern era is characterized by continual evolution. Ongoing research, technological breakthroughs, and evolving healthcare systems contribute to shaping the future of medicine as it continues to address emerging challenges and opportunities.</div>
